ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Hannah!

ðŸŽ¨ Passionate about code and colors, I'm a 19-year-old Java developer and OpenGL enthusiast. With a knack for translating ideas into visual masterpieces, I not only excel in crafting elegant Java applications but also thrive in the realm of computer graphics.

ðŸ’» As an OpenGL expert, I enjoy the challenge of creating immersive and visually stunning experiences through the power of graphics programming. Whether it's unleashing the potential of shaders or optimizing rendering pipelines, I'm always up for the exciting journey of pushing pixels to their limits.

ðŸš€ When I'm not diving deep into the world of code, you'll often find me wielding a paintbrush. I find solace in expressing my creativity on both digital and traditional canvases, merging the realms of technology and art.

ðŸŒŸ Join me on this adventure of coding, creativity, and continuous learning. Let's build something amazing together!
